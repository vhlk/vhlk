### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥°ðŸ’¬
My name's Victor Hugo. I'm a Computer Science student at Centro de InformÃ¡tica, Federal University of Pernambuco.

I'm currently working for [![SERPRO](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/908269_74c0b5f854fd456da2a017a6d28c0017~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_471,h_104,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/assinatura-serpro-govfederal-cor-horiz.png) SERPRO](https://www.serpro.gov.br/) as technology analyst.âš¡

On the free time I like to ride a bike, swimming, running, and also reading (right now I'm reading the collection "A Rainha Vermelha", by Victoria Aveyard).ðŸ“–

Oh, I forgot to mention, I *love* Halsey.ðŸ’–
