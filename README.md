### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥°ðŸ’¬
My name's Victor Hugo. I'm a Computer Science student at Centro de InformÃ¡tica, Federal University of Pernambuco.

I'm currently working for [![SERPRO](https://www.serpro.gov.br/) SERPRO](https://www.serpro.gov.br/) as technology analyst.âš¡

On the free time I like to ride a bike, swimming, running, and also reading (right now I'm reading the collection "A Rainha Vermelha", by Victoria Aveyard).ðŸ“–

Oh, I forgot to mention, I *love* Halsey.ðŸ’–
