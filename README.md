### Hi there 👋🥰💬
My name's Victor Hugo. I'm a Computer Science student at Centro de Informática, Federal University of Pernambuco.

I'm currently working for <a href="https://www.serpro.gov.br/">

On the free time I like to ride a bike, swimming, running, and also reading (right now I'm reading the collection "A Rainha Vermelha", by Victoria Aveyard).📖

Oh, I forgot to mention, I *love* Halsey.💖
