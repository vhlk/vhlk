### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ğŸ¥°ğŸ’¬
My name's Victor Hugo. I'm a Computer Science student at Centro de InformÃ¡tica, Federal University of Pernambuco.

I'm currently working for Voxar Labs as research scientist.âš¡

On the free time I like to ride a bike, and also I'm starting to love reading again.ğŸ“–

Oh, I forgot to mention, I *love* Halsey.ğŸ’–
